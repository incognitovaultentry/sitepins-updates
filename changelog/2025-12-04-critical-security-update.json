  "details": "Sitepins has been updated to address the **React2Shell (CVE-2025-55182)** vulnerability.\n\nBecause Sitepins is built with Next.js, we prioritized updating our core application to the latest patched version of the framework. This ensures our infrastructure and your projects remain protected.\n\n**Why this update was necessary:** A critical vulnerability was identified in how React Server Components (RSC) process data. Without this patch, unauthenticated attackers could execute remote code on the server.\n\n**Current Status:** The update has been successfully deployed. No action required on your part — Sitepins is now fully secured against this vulnerability."
